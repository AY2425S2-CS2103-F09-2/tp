* **EduEase** is a modified version of the AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) project, tailored specifically for private tutors.<br>
Example usages:
  * Helps tutors efficiently manage student contacts,
  * Track important dates
  * Organize students based on custom tags
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _EduEase_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `EduEase` but it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EduEase Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103-f09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
