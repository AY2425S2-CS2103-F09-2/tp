### Project: EduEase

EduEase - EduEase simplifies the management of student contact details, helping private tutors stay organized. It allows them to focus on delivering high-quality teaching while reducing administrative burdens, such as their studentsâ€™ progress and contacts, thereby enhancing their productivity. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Schedule New Sessions, Schedule Cancel, Schedule Edit
    * What it does: Enables tutors to schedule, cancel, and edit upcoming tutoring sessions with their students.
    * Justification: Tutors need an efficient tool to manage their upcoming sessions, ensuring they stay organized and on track with their students. This feature allows them to keep track of scheduled sessions and easily make adjustments to their schedule, improving time management and reducing the risk of missed sessions.
    * Highlights: Use of JavaFX for displaying session details in a user-friendly interface.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
