### Project: EduEase

EduEase simplifies the management of student contact details, helping private tutors stay organized. It allows them to focus on delivering high-quality teaching while reducing administrative burdens, such as their studentsâ€™ progress and contacts, thereby enhancing their productivity. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to switch between tabs
  * What it does: allows user to switch between tabs using the `switch` command
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user would want to switch between tabs to view different information. This feature allows the user to do so without having to use the mouse.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3`, `v1.4`, `v1.5` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Enhanced tabs feature by adding `switch` command to enable switching between tabs from the command line. Additionally, made tabs not closable as well. (Pull requests [\#126](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/126))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
