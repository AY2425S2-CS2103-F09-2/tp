### Project: EduEase

EduEase - EduEase simplifies the management of student contact details, helping private tutors stay organized. It allows them to focus on delivering high-quality teaching while reducing administrative burdens, such as their studentsâ€™ progress and contacts, thereby enhancing their productivity. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add notes on a student.
    * What it does: Allows user to view, append, overwrite or clear notes of a student.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to remember student's progress and weakness, enhancing their ability to personalise their lesson plan based on the student ability.
